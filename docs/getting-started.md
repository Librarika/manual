Now you need to verify your library before you can start entering books. Please open the activation email you have received from librarika in your mailbox. Click on the activation link to activate your library.

Once activated, you will receive a welcome email. You can now log into your libary and start using.

#### Have not received activation email yet

Sometime, your mail server may reject the emails we sent from librarika. It mostly happens with corporate mail servers with custom domains. If that happens, please discuss with your system administrator to whitelist librarika.com domain for your organization.

Email communication is very import for a library admin, so please make sure you receive the emails sent from Librarika. 

Otherwise, you will miss important emails regarding your library.
