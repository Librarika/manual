# Barcode Labels

Barcode Labels is the section that can be accessed by the librarians only. In this section the librarian can add single or multiple books and also add member barcode to the Barcode Queue. Once books are added to the queue then the librarian can generate barcodes. After the barcodes are generated they can print them out in standard label stationary or normal papers. Barcodes are very useful for the librarians as well as the library members.
