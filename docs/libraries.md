## Delete Library

You can remove your library anytime from the dashboard. All you need is the _Library Admin_ permission in order to delete your library. When you delete a library, the library information and your own user account, catalogs, checkouts, members information and other related information will be removed.

However, the individual login accounts created in Librarika platform either by library member or staff users will stay active even though they were part of your library users, this is becuase each user is treated independently in Librarika platform and one user can join multiple libraries using the same account.

Note: If you are on any paid plan (Premium Plan or E-Book Plan), please let us know so that we can discontinue your subscription before you delete your library.
