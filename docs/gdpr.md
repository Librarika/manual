2. Scope and Applicability of this DPA
2.1 This DPA applies where and only to the extent that Librarika processes Personal Data on behalf of the Customer in the course of providing the Services and such Personal Data is subject to Data Protection Laws of the European Union, the European Economic Area and/or their member states, Switzerland and/or the United Kingdom. The parties agree to comply with the terms and conditions in this DPA in connection with such Personal Data.

2.2 Role of the Parties. As between Librarika and Customer, Customer is the Controller of Personal Data and Librarika shall process Personal Data only as a Processor on behalf of Customer. Nothing in the Agreement or this DPA shall prevent Librarika from using or sharing any data that Librarika would otherwise collect and process independently of Customer's use of the Services.

2.3 Customer Obligations. Customer agrees that (i) it shall comply with its obligations as a Controller under Data Protection Laws in respect of its processing of Personal Data and any processing instructions it issues to Librarika; and (ii) it has provided notice and obtained (or shall obtain) all consents and rights necessary under Data Protection Laws for Librarika to process Personal Data and provide the Services pursuant to the Agreement and this DPA.

2.4 Librarika Processing of Personal Data. As a Processor, Librarika shall process Personal Data only for the following purposes: (i) processing to perform the Services in accordance with the Agreement; (ii) processing to perform any steps necessary for the performance of the Agreement; and (iii) to comply with other reasonable instructions provided by Customer to the extent they are consistent with the terms of this Agreement and only in accordance with Customer’s documented lawful instructions. The parties agree that this DPA and the Agreement set out the Customer’s complete and final instructions to Librarika in relation to the processing of Personal Data and processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between Customer and Librarika.

2.5 Nature of the Data. Librarika handles Customer Data provided by Customer. Such Customer Data may contain special categories of data depending on how the Services are used by Customer. The Customer Data may be subject to the following process activities: (i) storage and other processing necessary to provide, maintain and improve the Services provided to Customer; (ii) to provide customer and technical support to Customer; and (iii) disclosures as required by law or otherwise set forth in the Agreement.

2.6 Librarika Data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement (including this DPA), Customer acknowledges that Librarika shall have a right to use and disclose data relating to and/or obtained in connection with the operation, support and/or use of the Services for its legitimate business purposes, such as billing, account management, technical support, product development and sales and marketing. To the extent any such data is considered personal data under Data Protection Laws, Librarika is the Controller of such data and accordingly shall process such data in compliance with Data Protection Laws.

3. Subprocessing
3.1 Authorized Sub-processors. Customer agrees that Librarika may engage Sub-processors to process Personal Data on Customer's behalf. The Sub-processors currently engaged by Librarika and authorized by Customer are listed in Annex A.

3.2 Sub-processor Obligations. Librarika shall: (i) enter into a written agreement with the Sub-processor imposing data protection terms that require the Sub-processor to protect the Personal Data to the standard required by Data Protection Laws; and (ii) remain responsible for its compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of the Sub-processor that cause Librarika to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.

3.3 Changes to Sub-processors. Librarika shall provide Customer reasonable advance notice (for which email shall suffice) if it adds or removes Sub-processors.

3.4 Objection to Sub-processors. Customer may object in writing to Librarika’s appointment of a new Sub-processor on reasonable grounds relating to data protection by notifying Librarika promptly in writing within five (5) calendar days of receipt of Librarika’s notice in accordance with Section 3.3. Such notice shall explain the reasonable grounds for the objection. In such event, the parties shall discuss such concerns in good faith with a view to achieving commercially reasonable resolution. If this is not possible, either party may terminate the applicable Services that cannot be provided by Librarika without the use of the objected-to-new Sub-processor.

4. Security
4.1 Security Measures. Librarika shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data from Security Incidents and to preserve the security and confidentiality of the Personal Data, in accordance with Librarika's security standards described in Annex B (“Security Measures”).

4.2 Confidentiality of Processing. Librarika shall ensure that any person who is authorized by Librarika to process Personal Data (including its staff, agents and subcontractors) shall be under an appropriate obligation of confidentiality (whether a contractual or statutory duty).

4.3 Security Incident Response. Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Librarika shall notify Customer without undue delay and shall provide timely information relating to the Security Incident as it becomes known or as is reasonably requested by Customer.

4.4 Updates to Security Measures. Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures are subject to technical progress and development and that Librarika may update or modify the Security Measures from time to time provided that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security of the Services purchased by the Customer.

5. Security Reports and Audits
5.1 Librarika shall maintain records of its security standards. Upon Customer's written request, Librarika shall provide (on a confidential basis) copies of relevant external ISMS certifications, audit report summaries and/or other documentation reasonably required by Customer to verify Librarika's compliance with this DPA. Librarika shall further provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all reasonable requests for information made by Customer, including responses to information security and audit questionnaires, that Customer (acting reasonably) considers necessary to confirm Librarika's compliance with this DPA, provided that Customer shall not exercise this right more than once per year.

6. International Transfers
6.1 Processing Locations. Librarika stores and processes EU Data (defined below) in data centers located inside and outside the European Union. All other Customer Data may be transferred and processed in the United States and anywhere in the world where Customer, its Affiliates and/or its Sub-processors maintain data processing operations. Librarika shall implement appropriate safeguards to protect the Personal Data, wherever it is processed, in accordance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws. 

6.2 Transfer Mechanism: Notwithstanding Section 6.1, to the extent Librarika processes or transfers (directly or via onward transfer) Personal Data under this DPA from the European Union, the European Economic Area and/or their member states and Switzerland (“EU Data”) in or to countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of applicable Data Protection Laws of the foregoing territories, the parties agree that Librarika shall be deemed to provide appropriate safeguards for such data by virtue of having certified its compliance with the Privacy Shield and Librarika shall process such data in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles. Customer hereby authorises any transfer of EU Data to, or access to EU Data from, such destinations outside the EU subject to any of these measures having been taken.

7. Return or Deletion of Data
7.1 Upon deactivation of the Services, all Personal Data shall be deleted, save that this requirement shall not apply to the extent Librarika is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Personal Data, or to Personal Data it has archived on back-up systems, which such Personal Data Librarika shall securely isolate and protect from any further processing, except to the extent required by applicable law.

8. Cooperation
8.1 To the extent that Customer is unable to independently access the relevant Personal Data within the Services, Librarika shall (at Customer's expense) taking into account the nature of the processing, provide reasonable cooperation to assist Customer by appropriate technical and organizational measures, in so far as is possible, to respond to any requests from individuals or applicable data protection authorities relating to the processing of Personal Data under the Agreement. In the event that any such request is made directly to Librarika, Librarika shall not respond to such communication directly without Customer's prior authorization, unless legally compelled to do so. If Librarika is required to respond to such a request, Librarika shall promptly notify Customer and provide it with a copy of the request unless legally prohibited from doing so.

8.2 To the extent Librarika is required under Data Protection Law, Librarika shall (at Customer's expense) provide reasonably requested information regarding Librarika's processing of Personal Data under the Agreement to enable the Customer to carry out data protection impact assessments or prior consultations with data protection authorities as required by law.

9. Miscellaneous
9.1 Except for the changes made by this DPA, the Agreement remains unchanged and in full force and effect. If there is any conflict between this DPA and the Agreement, this DPA shall prevail to the extent of that conflict.

9.2 This DPA is a part of and incorporated into the Agreement so references to "Agreement" in the Agreement shall include this DPA.

9.3 In no event shall any party limit its liability with respect to any individual's data protection rights under this DPA or otherwise.

9.4 This DPA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the Agreement, unless required otherwise by Data Protection Laws.
