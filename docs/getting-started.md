	Enter full name of your library. Example: _The Liberty School Library_.

	Enter your email address carefully. This email address will be used to log you into the library.

#### Activate Your Library

Now you need to verify your library before you can start entering books. Please open the activation email you have received from Librarika in your mailbox. Click on the activation link to activate your library.

Once activated, you will receive a welcome email. You can now log into your libary and start using.

#### Have not received activation email yet?

Sometime, your mail server may reject the emails we sent from librarika. It mostly happens with corporate mail servers with custom domains. If that happens, please discuss with your system administrator to whitelist librarika.com domain for your organization.

Email communication is very important for a library admin, so please make sure you receive the emails sent from Librarika. 

Otherwise, you will miss important emails regarding your library.


#### Multiple Libraries

It is ok to create multiple libraries under the same Librarika account.

## Join a Library

You can join a library in two different ways.

* A library staff may invite you to join their library as a member (patron).
* Or, you can sign up for a Librarika account on your own. Then submit a member access request to a specific library of your choice.

Both methods are covered in this section.
